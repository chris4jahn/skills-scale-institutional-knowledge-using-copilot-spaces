# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with an iterative, outcome-oriented lifecycle that moves work from Initiation through Planning, Execution, Release, and Close. Initiation uses a Project One‑pager to validate the problem, stakeholders, success metrics, and a go/no‑go decision. Planning turns approved initiatives into a prioritized, estimated backlog, defines a Definition of Done, identifies dependencies and risks, and produces a release/milestone map. Execution focuses on small, shippable increments tracked on a project board and uses short feedback cycles to iterate toward measurable outcomes.

Clear roles definitions underpin delivery: Product Managers own outcomes, problem statements, and prioritization; Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Developers implement features, tests, and reviews; and QA validates acceptance criteria. These personas collaborate closely—PM and PdM align on priorities and timelines, developers participate in design and code review, and owners are named for risks and action items—so accountability and single points of contact are explicit.

Communication and workflow conventions emphasize rapid visibility and predictable handoffs. Team rhythm includes daily standups, delivery syncs, sprint demos, and scheduled PM+PdM check‑ins; stakeholder updates occur regularly and ad‑hoc escalations follow defined paths. The pull request workflow enforces small PRs, linkage to issues and acceptance criteria, CI checks and security scans before review, and at least one approval before merge. Cross‑team dependencies and risks are surfaced on the board and tracked in a risk register with owners and mitigation plans.

Quality assurance and release practices are formalized: developers write unit and integration tests, teams maintain end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, and CI runs tests and security scanners. Releases follow a checklist (pre‑release verification, release notes, rollback/mitigation plan, staging smoke tests) and an incident playbook for failed deployments. Metrics (velocity, burndown, and project‑level success signals) and retrospectives feed continuous improvement—action items are tracked into the backlog with owners and due dates so the team measures impact over time.
